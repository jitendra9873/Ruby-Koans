    # default return value, then you should use hash.fetch

    # For ease of syntax. Recall from earlier that you CANT do assert_equal <hash literal here>, my_hash. Storing the
    # hash (expected) as an intermediate variable and then checking against was easier so that you wouldn't have to do
    # assert_equal ( {:one => "eins", :two => "dos" } ), hash -- NOTE the parenthesis around the first argument
